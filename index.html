              Hello, i'am Matius Febrian Chisto form East Java. I'am 19 years old. I have 2 brothers and i the youngest
              child of 3 siblings.
              I like music and some sports like badminton. I also have a hobby of playing musical instruments like the
              guitar, I've liked it for a long time.
              I graduated from <a href="https://smkn1nglegok.sch.id/" target="_blank" class="text-link">SMKN 1 NGLEGOK</a> 
              and have worked for 7 months as a Network Engineer.
            </p>
            <p>      
              Besides that, I also like programming, especially web or frontend programming. Since I was in middle school, I've always liked programming and have tried to make a simple web. However, due to constraints by the device, this has not materialized. I also did an internship as a frontend developer at <strong><a href="https://www.agunacourse.com/" target="_blank" class="text-link">Aguna Course</a> </strong>. That's where I want to learn and know more about programming

        <h2>Why work in the field of Networking?</h2>
        <img src="assets/img/network.svg" alt="networking" class="featured-image" />
        <p>
          Why do I prefer to work in the Network? Because to fill spare time and take advantage of what I have learned at school. I am majoring in Network and Computer Engineering. With basic network skills, it will be easier for me to work in the field of networking. However, this did not reduce my interest in becoming a programmer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even though I work as a Network Engineer, I still continue to study programming, especially web programming. I'm always looking for loopholes or free time to learn about it. Sometimes it's a little tiring because you are led to be able to network but you also want to learn programming. But I kept on going and never gave up. because I hope one day I can become a programmer
