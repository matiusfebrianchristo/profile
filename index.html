                Hello, i'am Matius Febrian Chisto form East Java, Indonesia. I'am 20 years old. I have 2 brothers and i the youngest
                child of 3 siblings.
                I like music and some sports like badminton. In music, I usually like playing guitar, keyboard and maybe drums, I've liked it for a long time.
                I graduated from <strong><a href="https://smkn1nglegok.sch.id/" target="_blank" class="text-link">SMKN 1 NGLEGOK</a> </strong>
                and have worked for 1 year and 10 months as a Network Engineer. 
              </p>
              <p>      
                Besides that, I also like programming, especially web programming. Since I was in middle school, I've always liked programming and have tried to make a simple web. However, due to constraints by the device, this has not materialized. I also did an internship as a frontend developer at <strong><a href="https://www.agunacourse.com/" target="_blank" class="text-link">Aguna Course</a> </strong>. That's where I want to learn and know more about programming.
              </p>
              <p>      
                And I also like to learn new things, especially in the field of programming, such as trying to create automation to make it easier for me to do a job. Even though I work as a Network Engineer, I still continue to study programming, especially web programming. I'm always looking for loopholes or free time to learn about it. Sometimes it's a bit tiring because I'm required to be able to network but also want to learn programming. I keep going and never give up because I hope one day I can become a programmer.

              <p>
                Javascript was the first programming language I knew about. For years I was stuck on JavaScript because it was difficult to learn, but when I was in high school, I could start to understand it. I tried making websites using JavaScript and even did an internship as a frontend where JavaScript was the main programming language at that time. I understand several frameworks such as VueJS and NuxtJS from where I interned.

              <p>
                I understand basic PHP. I learned this when I was in high school by trying to create a website with a PHP login system. Some of the features that I built are register or create users, delete users, authentication and edit users. Of course this was related to the database where I was using MySQL at that time. I understand enough about MySQL that I use it to create PHP-based websites.

              <p>
                I recently learned about the Python programming language. I understand basic Python programming. I use Python where I work, where the programming is used to create document automation with the purpose of make it easier to create so many documents and reducing the number of edits to these documents. And this has been going on until now.
              </p>

              <p>
                I understand quite well about MySQL databases. This database is related to the PHP programming that I use. I also made a project at school, namely creating a PHP-based login web using a MySQL database where users can also create new data/register, delete or edit and authentication.

                Apart from programming, I also understand the basics of networking such as routing, point-to-point, subnetting. I also understand quite a lot about several brands of network devices such as Cisco, Nokia, ZTE and Huawei.

                Why do I prefer to work in the Network? Because to fill spare time and take advantage of what I have learned at school. I am majoring in Network and Computer Engineering. With basic network skills, it will be easier for me to work in the field of networking. However, this did not reduce my interest in becoming a programmer.
