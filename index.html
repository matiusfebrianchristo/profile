              <p>
                Hello, i'am Matius Febrian Chisto form East Java, Indonesia. I'am 20 years old. I have 2 brothers and i the youngest
                child of 3 siblings.
                I like music and some sports like badminton. In music, I usually like playing guitar, keyboard and maybe drums, I've liked it for a long time.
                I graduated from <strong><a href="https://smkn1nglegok.sch.id/" target="_blank" class="text-link">SMKN 1 NGLEGOK</a> </strong>
                and have worked for 1 year and 10 months as a Network Engineer. 
              </p>
              <p>      
                Besides that, I also like programming, especially web programming. Since I was in middle school, I've always liked programming and have tried to make a simple web. However, due to constraints by the device, this has not materialized. I also did an internship as a frontend developer at <strong><a href="https://www.agunacourse.com/" target="_blank" class="text-link">Aguna Course</a> </strong>. That's where I want to learn and know more about programming
              </p>
              <p>      
                And I also like to learn new things, especially in the field of programming, such as trying to create automation to make it easier for me to do a job. Even though I work as a Network Engineer, I still continue to study programming, especially web programming. I'm always looking for loopholes or free time to learn about it. Sometimes it's a bit tiring because I'm required to be able to network but also want to learn programming. I keep going and never give up because I hope one day I can become a programmer

              <p>
                I know some programming languages ​​such as <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Python</b>. Although sometimes I need to open notes but I can understand the meaning of a line of the program. Not only basic Javascript, but also the framework of javascript, namely <b>VueJS</b> and <b>NuxtJS</b>. I have also learned <b>PHP</b> and <b>MySQL</b> database when I am free.

              <p>
                Why do I prefer to work in the Network? Because to fill spare time and take advantage of what I have learned at school. I am majoring in Network and Computer Engineering. With basic network skills, it will be easier for me to work in the field of networking. However, this did not reduce my interest in becoming a programmer.
